• Binary file operations

Using ios_base::binary we read, for example, the data from a file without formatting. There's no
conversion of data, so the content of a file in that case is unreadable for us. 


• Binding a function to its arguments

When the name of a function is passed as a parameter into a function such as std::thread() then
the parameter of that function are also passed in sequence. Then, when that function is called its
returns the corresponding function object.
Example: 
	void func(int a) {...}
	int main....
		int a = 4;
		std::thread t(func, a);

		
• Multi-threading

It contains various sequences of programs instructios that are called threads. Each thread 
works independently to improve the execution time. This feature is related to languages 
which are Object Oriented.
