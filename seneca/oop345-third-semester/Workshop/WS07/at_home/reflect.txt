• The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.

The vector was used because it's the most similar container compare to an array. Another point
is that vectors handle their destruction when a object is out of scope.


• List the STL template functions that you used in your solution.

pair<T,T>, accumulate(), for_each(), sort()


• Identify where you used lambda expressions.

It was used in the functions below:
	pair<T, T> sumPair() const;
	T sigma() const;
	T slope() const;


• Comment on the ease of programming associated with the STL.

Using the containers from the libraries is much easier to deal with data process, adding data or getting data from them



*** QUIZ 7 ***
	
6. 
	smart pointer has a longer lifetime
	
7. 
	// raw pointer syntax
	void foo(int x) {
		Car* car = new Car(x);
		car->drive();
		delete car;
	}
	
	// smart pointer syntax
	void foo(int x) {
		std::unique_ptr<Car> car = new Car(x);
		car->drive();
	}
	
8. 
	std::shared_ptr<type>
