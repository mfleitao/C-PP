1) Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size of an existing array of 
dynamically allocated memory?

Because it's not possible to increase the size of an array after it has been declared. For this, it's
necessary declare a new array with the new size (increased) and then copy the elements of previous
array to the new one. After that, the original array must be deallocated.


2) The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array of characters. At the end of the 
program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name. Why donâ€™t 
we need to use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain.

Once the strucutre variable is deleted using the command "delete", a default destructor is called 
which also deletes the structure members as well. 


3) There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to 
call from your main function?

The compiler knows which function must be called because of the function assignature, which contains
different parameters. 


4) Explain what have you have learned in this workshop.

I have learned about the usage of Overloading of functions. We can have same function with different 
assignatures and definitions as well. The usage of address and references. And the importance of
dynamic memory and how to allocate and deallocate it. 



// **** Quiz #1 Reflection ****
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) What is the one definition rule?

Onde definition rule means that a definition must be done just once with same code block.


2) The scope of a declaration is the portion of a program over whici that declaration is visible. List
two (of the five) examples of scopes and explain where contents of the scope are visible.

global scope, which is visible to the whole program;
file scope, which is visible to the source code within the file;
function scope, which is visible to the source code within the function;
class scope, which is visible to the member functions of the class;
block scope, which is visible to the code block.


3) With respect to scope, what is shadowing?

It's a variable declared within a scope which has the same name of a variable declared out of that 
scope previously.
