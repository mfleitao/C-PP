1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define a safe empty state that differs from the empty state 
that you defined?	

Safe Empty State is when we use the Constructor to initialize the members to ensure that they will
be ready to be used properly. The information can be valided before being set. 
What differs safe empty state to empty state is where they are defined. Safe empty state is defined
within the constructor initializing the members at the same time of object creatio. whereas empty 
state is defined in a 'set()' function which must be called after the object creation.


2) Identify the parts of your source code where to minimized code duplication.

There are three different constructors which need the same block of code to initialize the "safe empty
state", so for this it was created a private function that contains the block code which make it. Then
this private function was used to optmize the constructors.  


3) The canTravelWith(...) member function accesses the private data of the object referenced in its 
parameter. Explain why C++ allows this access.

It's allowed because of the usage of "Passenger::" before the name of the function. It's allows that 
the funcion access private members of class.


4) What statement did you add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?

A const "max_length" which contains the limit number for passager name and destination was added to
ensure that the function make the copy properly: "strncpy(this->passengerName, name, max_length);"


5) Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

I've learned about the usage of constructor and how to overload to have diferente types of initialization.
Also, learned about safe empty state and its importance and the usage of "this".

2) Which of the following is false of a destructor?

	B) It must be called explicity

4) True or False, the compiler does not insert an empty-body, no-argument constructor into a class
definition that declares any form of constructor?

	TRUE
	
6) True of False, when an array goes out of scope, the first element calls its destructor first and
the last element calls its destructor last.

	FALSE
