1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile 
if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

If the functions are at Data.cpp file the compiler doesn't create the functions properly to swap as 
necessary to apply the specific type wanted. 
Yes, the source code does compile properly and template functions are localted at Data.h file. Doing
this the when the function is called it determines the specialization that the compilers created, then
binds the call specialization.


2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template 
function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

Moving a templated function into the Main file does not compile. Normally, a function needs to be 
declared above main() before being definied at the bottom, but int that case didn't work both scnearios. 


3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to 
accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?

Yes, it could done by using overloading and create two or more functions with the type needed. However, 
using templated functions we have less code, which is much better having just one function with a 
generic signature and let the compiler do rest for us. 


4. Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T>
template<typename T>

Yes, they are. The different is that first one is for class, which make a class generic then it can be used
for the entire class. 
The second one is for a single function, which means that only that function is generic.
